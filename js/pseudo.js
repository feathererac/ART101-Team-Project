// Pseudo Code for ART 101 Group Project:

// Make button to pull lever of slot machine (traditional three in a row slot machine)

//Player starts with ten tokens (will be playtested). Ech spin on gambiing machine costs one token

// If button is clicked, animation of lever is triggered
    //Token counter goes down by one
    //animation of slot machine spinning

// After lever is pulled nd results are revealed, possible responses:
    // Try again!
    // It's okay, go for it!
    // JACKPOT!

// When player is out of tokens, Gambo (mascot character) responds:
    // Prompts user to keep pulling, asked "would you like to keep pulling?"/ "Would you like to play again?"
    // Players cannot say no, even if they keep clicking the no button
    // It will eventually turn into a yes by force.


// After player is forced to continue, the Item Shop is introduced

// Player will constantly return to the item shop after pulls to "sell" items in exchange for tokens

// Item Shop refreshes and builds up to bigger and bigger items (starts small [eg. electronics], then goes to bigger items)
    // Possible Inventory includes: electronics (game console, IPad, etc.), car, deed to house, family members, heirlooms (wedding ring, college degree, etc.), idetification items (SSn, credit card, ID, etc.)
    // Maybe if we want it to be like can your pet, where it's super shocking or whatever, we could even do things like "an arm" "a leg" (like the idiom an arm and a leg) or your kidneys, your firstborn child, your body (oop :eyes:) etc.
// Last thing you sell is your soul!

// When you can no longer sell things to get tokens in the shop, it moves on to the end where Gambo breaks the 4th wall and stares at the user.
    // Has to be silent regardless of whether we add music or not

// This is the point where the receipt is introduced, and you see everything (and other things) that you sold off in order to continue gambling.


//Must Have Elements:
    // Tokens are named "GamBits"
    // Scrolling Receipt
    // Post Receipt Screen with the "real" stuff: statistics, resources, etc.

//Benchmark Goals
    // Poking Gambo irritates them. prompts window saying "What are you doing?" "Leave me alone weirdo!" "Why are you ckicking on me, focus on the game!"
    // Add audio triggers when clicking button or during certain scenes (minus the serious 4 wall break)
    // Music?
    // Secret Item Shop option of robbing a bank?
